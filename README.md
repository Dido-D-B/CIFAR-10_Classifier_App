This project demonstrates how **transfer learning with ResNet50** can classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories. The final model is deployed as a Streamlit web app for interactive testing.

## Project Overview

* **Objective**: Build and deploy an image classifier for CIFAR-10 (10 classes, 60k images).
* **Approach**:
  * Used ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet.
  * Fine-tuned on 10k training samples with data augmentation.
  * Applied layer-wise unfreezing and learning rate scheduling.
  * Deployed model in a Streamlit app with visualization tools.

## Dataset

* **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 32Ã—32 RGB images, 10 classes (e.g., airplane, cat, dog, ship).
* **Training set**: 50,000 images
* **Test set**: 10,000 images

## Model Architecture

* **Base**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
* **Custom head**: Dense layers + BatchNorm + Dropout + Softmax
* **Techniques**:
  * Label smoothing
  * Early stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau
  * Cosine decay learning rate schedule

## Results

* Transfer learning worked well even with limited data (10k samples) ï¿¼
* Achieved strong generalization through data augmentation & careful fine-tuning
* Visualization of metrics (accuracy/loss, confusion matrix) provided key insights

## Key Metrics

* **Accuracy**: (insert your final % here if available)
* **Challenges**:
  * Small input size (32Ã—32 vs 224Ã—224 expected by ResNet50)
  * Confusing classes (cat/dog/bird overlap)
  * Careful tuning of learning rates required

## Demo App
